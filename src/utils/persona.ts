        name: 'Adventurer',
        summary: 'Adventurers are flexible and charming, always ready to explore and experience something new.',
        introduction: 'You are a true artist - although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For you, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what you wear to how you spend your free time, you act in ways that vividly reflect who you are as unique individuals. With your exploratory spirit and your ability to find joy in everyday life, you can be among the most interesting people others will ever meet. Driven by your sense of fairness and your open-mindedness, you move through life with an infectiously encouraging attitude. You love motivating those close to you to follow their passions and usually follow your own interests with the same unhindered enthusiasm. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, you tend to see yourself as “just doing my own thing,” so you may not even realize how remarkable you really are.',
        strengths: [
            'Charming: You are relaxed and warm, and your “live and let live” attitude naturally makes you likable and popular.',
            'Sensitive to Others: You easily relate to others’ emotions, helping you establish harmony and goodwill and minimize conflict. You are even able to perceive others’ emotions just by listening to their voices.',
            'Kind and Encouraging: You possess an innate kindness and fairness that fuels your understanding and empathy toward others and often helps you to create a safe space for others to express their thoughts and feelings. You generally adopt an encouraging disposition, always ready to cheer others on in the pursuit of their passions.',
            'Imaginative: You use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, your vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help others like you in unexpected ways.',
            'Passionate: Beneath your quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When you are caught up in something exciting and interesting, you can leave everything else in the dust.'
        ],
        weaknesses: [
            'Difficulty with Structure: Freedom of expression is often your top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression. This can make more rigidly structured contexts a challenge.',
            'Unpredictable: You dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in your romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.',
            'Easily Stressed: You live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, you can shut down, losing your characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.',
            'Difficulty with Technical Problem-Solving: You are not the type to build, repair, or try a hands-on approach when faced with technical issues. Your preference for observation over direct, practical involvement often holds you back from dealing effectively with mechanical or technical problem-solving.',
            'Fluctuating Self-Esteem: It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with your strengths of sensitivity and exploration. Your efforts are too often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. You can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.'
        ],
        romance: 'You can be quite mysterious and difficult to get to know. While very emotional, you guard this sensitive core carefully, preferring to listen than to express. You focus instead on your partner, with little interest in dictating the mood of a situation with your own feelings. While this can sometimes be frustrating, if you are accepted for who you are, you prove to be a warm, enthusiastic partner.',
        friendship: 'You approach your friendships much like you approach life - with curiosity, open-mindedness, and a keen appreciation for individuality. You are the friend who is there to cheer someone on during their highest highs and offer a shoulder during their lowest lows. Your adeptness at picking up on emotional cues and understanding feelings allows you to be a highly empathetic friend who provides a reassuring presence and a listening ear in times of crisis or confusion.',
        parenthood: 'When it comes to parenting, you are likely to foster a nonjudgmental, safe space for your children to express themselves openly, believing that each child deserves the freedom to follow their unique path. While no one is ever completely prepared for the undertaking of becoming a parent, your natural warmth, practicality, and relaxed nature help you to settle in quickly and appreciate every moment of joy and hardship that comes with raising a child.',
        career: 'When it comes to the career world, you need more than just a job. Wealth, power, structure, advancement, and security, while all fine in their own right, are often second to your greatest need: creative freedom. You crave a tangible outlet for your imagination, a chance to express your idea of what works.',
        workplace: 'In the workplace, you seek out positions that give you enough freedom to express your zest for spontaneous actions and authentic emotional experiences. Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to you. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, you just want a chance to express those natural qualities and to know that your efforts are appreciated.',

    INFJ: {
        name: 'Advocate',
        summary: 'Advocates are quiet visionaries, often serving as inspiring and tireless idealists.',
        introduction: 'Idealistic and principled, you are not content to coast through life - you want to stand up and make a difference. For you, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. While you have lofty goals and ambitions, you shouldn’t be mistaken for an idle dreamer. You care about integrity, and you are rarely satisfied until you’ve done what you know to be right. Conscientious to the core, you move through life with a clear sense of your values, and you aim to never lose sight of what truly matters - not according to other people or society at large but according to your own wisdom and intuition.',
        strengths: [
            'Insightful: You know all too well that appearances can be misleading. You strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give you an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.',
            'Principled: You tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. You consider lying to be morally wrong, and you make a concerted effort to not deceive others: even when you could directly benefit from doing so. In fact, you are the least likely to say you sometimes take advantage of other people.',
            'Passionate: You crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, you want to chase after your dreams. You don’t shy away from shooting for the stars: you are energized and impassioned by the beauty of your visions for the future.',
            'Altruistic: You aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. You want to use your strengths for the greater good, and you rarely lose sight of how your words and actions might affect others. In your heart of hearts, you want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around you.',
            'Creative: You aren’t exactly like everyone else: and that’s a wonderful thing. You embrace your creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express yourself and think outside the box.'
        ],
        weaknesses: [
            'Sensitive to Criticism: You are often averse to criticism, especially if you believe that someone is challenging your most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to you, you can become defensive, dismissive, or angry.',
            'Reluctant to Open Up: You value honesty and authenticity, but you’re also private. You may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about your struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with your issues. Unfortunately, when you don’t ask for help, you may inadvertently hold yourself back or create distance in your relationships.',
            'Perfectionistic: You are all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. You might find it difficult to appreciate your job, living situation, or relationship if you’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether you should be looking for something better.',
            'Avoiding the Ordinary: You yearn to do extraordinary things with your life. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless you translate your dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, you may struggle to turn your grand visions into reality.',
            'Prone to Burnout: Your perfectionism and reserve leave you with few options for letting off steam. You can exhaust yourself if you don’t balance your drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.'
        ],
        romance: 'You look for depth and meaning in your relationships - and your romantic relationships are no different. You have a vibrant, vivid imagination, but can’t imagine yourself settling for a match founded on anything less than true love.',
        friendship: 'You rarely settle for shallow, superficial friendships. When it comes to social fulfillment, you aren’t satisfied by casual interactions with colleagues or classmates. You crave authentic, meaningful friendships - friendships that allow you to share your dreams, bare your soul, and feel understood and accepted for who you are. And if that means having just one or two confidants rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, so be it.',
        parenthood: 'As a parent, you have a clear vision for what matters to you: raising your children to be independent and all-around good people. You take your responsibilities seriously, and if you become a parent, you think deeply about how you can shape your children’s lives and experiences in positive ways.',
        career: 'For you, professional decisions are not guided by conventional yardsticks of success like financial gain or status but by the potential your work holds for meaningful connection and personal fulfillment. You long to find a career that aligns with your values and your dreams - a career that allows you to fulfill your unique mission in this world. To you, a job isn’t satisfying if it doesn’t offer a deeper sense of purpose - no matter how good the salary is. The good news is that you can use your creativity and determination to find work that suits your needs in just about any field.',
        workplace: 'You have some specific needs when it comes to a satisfying work environment - the most rewarding work allows you to help others while also growing as a person. And it’s a given that an ideal career for you must be in line with your individual values. Anything that gets in the way of these values - from red tape and meaningless rules to office politics and unscrupulous coworkers - can seriously sap your motivation. You thrive in environments that promote fairness and equality. You prefer not to think of yourself as above or below anyone else - no matter where you are on the job ladder.',

    INTJ: {
        name: 'Architect',
        summary: 'Architects are imaginative and strategic thinkers, with a plan for everything.',
        introduction: 'You are an intellectually curious individual with a deep-seated thirst for knowledge. You tend to value creative ingenuity, straightforward rationality, and self-improvement. You consistently work toward enhancing intellectual abilities and are often driven by an intense desire to master any and every topic that piques you interest. Logical and quick-witted, you pride yourself on your ability to think for yourself, not to mention your uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. Because your mind is never at rest, you may sometimes struggle to find people who can keep up with your nonstop analysis of everything around you. But when you do find like-minded individuals who appreciate your intensity and depth of thought, you form profound and intellectually stimulating relationships that you deeply treasure.',
        strengths: [
            'Rational: You pride yourself on the power of your mind. You can reframe nearly any challenge as an opportunity to hone your rational thinking skills and expand your knowledge: and with this mindset, you can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.',
            'Informed: Few are as devoted as you to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, you base your conclusions on research and analysis. This gives you the conviction that you need to stand up for your ideas, even in the face of disagreement.',
            'Independent: For you, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, you strive to do things your own way. You can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of your success. Moreover, you are happy to make decisions without outside input or opinions. You prefer to take matters into your own hands.',
            'Determined: You are known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. You won’t rest until you’ve achieved your own definition of success: which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to you. You are not known for taking the easy way out. You feel that the only way to achieve greatness is to face challenges head on.',
            'Curious: You are open to new ideas: as long as those ideas are rational and evidence based, that is. Skeptical by nature, you are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, you are generally happy to revise your opinions.',
            'Original: Without you, the world would be a far less interesting place. Your rebellious streak is responsible for some of history’s most unconventional ideas and inventions. Even in your everyday life, you force the people around you to consider new (and sometimes surprising) ways of looking at things.'
        ],
        weaknesses: [
            'Arrogant: You might be knowledgeable, but you’re not infallible. Your self-assurance can blind you to useful input from other people - especially anyone you deem to be intellectually inferior. You can also come across as needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.',
            'Dismissive of Emotions: For you, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than you care to admit. You can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias - one that can cloud your judgment.',
            'Overly Critical: You tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their life fail to match your level of restraint, you can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair - based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.',
            'Combative: You hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. You can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations - but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.',
            'Socially Clueless: Your relentless rationality can lead to frustration in your social lives. Your efforts to defy expectations may leave you feeling isolated or disconnected from other people. At times, you may become cynical about the value of relationships altogether, questioning the importance of love and connection.'
        ],
        romance: 'You approach romance the way you do most challenges: strategically, with clear goals and a plan for achieving them. In a purely rational world, this approach would be foolproof, but matters of love are rarely rational. Consequently, you are at risk of overlooking or misinterpreting the unpredictability of human nature and affection. For you, finding a compatible partner can be a particular challenge. Being innately logical, you seek not just companionship but also intellectual stimulation from your partner - an uncommon quest offering its own unique rewards and challenges.',
        friendship: 'Sharp-witted and darkly funny, you aren’t everyone’s cup of tea - and you’re okay with that. For the most part, you don’t really care about being considered “cool.” And you don’t spend your time and energy on just anyone. Instead, you save yourself for friends who can match your intellectual curiosity and keep pace with your fast-moving mind.',
        parenthood: 'You are known for your rationality and self-control, and you may be bemused by anyone who doesn’t share these strengths - for example, children. For you, parenting often requires mastering new skills and developing cognitive flexibility. Fortunately, you are pretty much always up for a challenge - and for those who have children, parenthood can be an especially meaningful challenge to take on.',
        career: 'You are rarely satisfied by work that is too easy. You want a career that fires up your curiosity and leverages your intellect, allowing you to expand your prowess as you tackle meaningful challenges and problems. If a job’s description makes the average person think, “Wow, that sounds hard,” then it might just be a good fit for you.',
        workplace: 'Wherever you may be on the career ladder, you want to pursue your professional goals according to your own standards. And if anyone has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly you. You are an innate problem-solver who is always looking for better, more efficient ways to accomplish tasks.',

        name: 'Campaigner',
        summary: 'Campaigners are enthusiastic, creative, and sociable free spirits, who can always find a reason to smile.',
        introduction: 'You are a true free spirit - outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With your lively, upbeat approach to life, you stand out in any crowd. But even though you can be the life of the party, you don’t just care about having a good time. You have profound depths that are fueled by your intense desire for meaningful, emotional connections with others. You carry an interesting blend of carefree sociability, sparkling imagination, and deep, contemplative introspection. You regularly use you natural curiosity and expansive creativity to try to better understand yourself and the complex dynamics of human relationships. And you are truly devoted to nurturing your relationships with and your understanding of the world at large.',
        strengths: [
            'Curious: You can find beauty and fascination in nearly anything. Imaginative and open-minded, you aren’t afraid to venture beyond your comfort zone in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures. Moreover, your curiosity extends beyond simply seeking novelty. You also have a deep desire to understand how things work and why they are the way they are.',
            'Perceptive: To you, no one is unimportant - which might explain how you can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because you’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, you can make full use of your caring, considerate nature.',
            'Enthusiastic: When something captures your imagination and inspires you, you want to share it with anyone who will listen. And you’re just as eager to hear other people’s ideas and opinions - even if those thoughts are wildly different from your own.',
            'Excellent Communicators: You brim with things to say, but you can be caring listeners as well. This gives you a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people - even people who aren’t particularly sociable or agreeable.',
            'Easygoing: You may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but you can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. You know how to find fun and joy in the present moment - and few things give you more pleasure than sharing your joy with others.',
            'Good-Natured and Positive: You are warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. You strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and your circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.'
        ],
        weaknesses: [
            'People-Pleasing: You are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain the peace, you may compromise on things that matter to you or allow others to treat you poorly. And when you fail to win someone over, you might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it.',
            'Unfocused: The thrill of a new project - especially one that involves collaborating with other people - can bring out the best in you. But you are known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that you may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term.',
            'Disorganized: You focus on the big picture and your love for exploring new ideas and experiences can sometimes overshadow your attention to everyday practical matters. Specifically, you may try to avoid the routine tasks that you view as boring like household chores, basic maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in your life.',
            'Overly Accommodating: You feel called to uplift others, and you may find yourself saying yes whenever anyone asks you for guidance or help. But unless you set boundaries, you can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of your own life.',
            'Overly Optimistic: Optimism can be among your key strengths. But your rosy outlook can lead you to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned your trust. This trait can also make it difficult for you to accept hard but necessary truths - and to share those truths with others.',
            'Restless: With your positive, upbeat attitude, you rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But your inner idealism can leave you with a nagging feeling that some major areas of your life just aren’t good enough - whether that’s your work, your home life, or your relationships.'
        ],
        romance: 'It’s hard to overstate just how much you care about love. You are a passionate, warm, and openhearted individual full of hopes, dreams, and ideas, longing for a life of rich experiences. And you bring every ounce of this vibrant energy to your romantic relationships. You harbor a deep longing to share your life with another person. As a result, you may feel a bit empty or uninspired when you’re single. While your dedication to relationships is admirable, you may need to guard against investing too much of your sense of self in your relationship status.',
        friendship: 'With your natural vivacity, you are effortlessly sociable. You generally make friends wherever you go using your charm and your excellent communication skills to draw in an interesting and diverse social circle - something that you take pride in. As a friend, you are uplifting and supportive. You’re nearly always up for a little lighthearted banter - or a deep, heartfelt discussion about anything and everything. Moreover, you have a knack for making your friends feel seen, valued, and appreciated.',
        parenthood: 'For you, one of the great joys of parenthood is sharing your sense of wonder and inspiration with your children. Few things feel more rewarding to you than seeing your child light up with curiosity about the world around them, take steps to discover how things work, and use their knowledge to help make society better. You do not merely want your children to survive in the world - you want to inspire them to change it.',
        career: 'You are known for having a wealth of ideas, interests, and hobbies - to the extent that you may struggle to fit everything that you care about into your life. It’s no surprise, then, that choosing a career path can leave you feeling overwhelmed or scattered. You want to add value to the world, build community, facilitate learning, and express your creativity through your work. Consequently, you may feel pulled in multiple directions, uncertain of how to honor both your passions and your values while still keeping your options open and pulling in a steady paycheck.',
        workplace: 'Marked by inherent charisma and original imaginations, you bring a unique energy into your professional environment. You are passionate about brainstorming with your team and tend to excel in positions of leadership due to your ability to infuse the workplace with positivity and encouragement.

        summary: 'Commanders are bold, imaginative, and strong-willed, always finding a way - or making one.',
        introduction: 'You are decisive person who loves momentum and accomplishment. You gather information to construct your creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them. You are a natural-born leader. Embodying the gifts of charisma and confidence, you project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, you are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using your drive, determination, and sharp mind to achieve whatever objectives you’ve set for yourself. Your intensity might sometimes rub people the wrong way, but ultimately, you take pride in both your work ethic and your impressive level of self-discipline.',
        strengths: [
            'Efficient: You see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right but as something that pulls time and energy away from all your future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. You will root out such behavior wherever you go.',
            'Energetic: You approach your responsibilities with vigor and drive. You are not the type to shy away from busy schedules or complex challenges. In fact, the more you are able to accomplish throughout the day, the more energized you feel, and you will happily share this infectious enthusiasm for productivity with the people around you.',
            'Self-Confident: You generally make your opinions known, trust in your ability to get things done, and believe in your capacity as a leader. You are the most likely person to say they feel confident facing life’s day-to-day challenges.',

        ],
        weaknesses: [
            'Stubborn and Dominant: Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far. You are all too capable of digging in your heels, trying to win every single debate, and only pushing for your vision without considering the input of others.',
            'Intolerant: You are notoriously unsupportive of ideas that distract from your primary goals and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. You won’t hesitate to make that fact clear to those around you.',
            'Impatient: Some people need more time to think than others - an intolerable delay to your quick-thinking. You may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in your haste - a terrible mistake to make.',
            'Arrogant: You respect quick thoughts and firm convictions and may look down on those who don’t match up. This is a challenge for others, who are perhaps not timid in their own right but will seem so beside your sometimes overbearing nature.',
            'Poor Handling of Emotions: At times, you can be distant from your own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. You often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting your partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.',
            'Cold and Ruthless: Your obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, make you fairly insensitive in pursuing your goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational or irrelevant.'

        romance: 'You tend to approach dating and relationships with a set of goals and a plan to achieve them, and you proceed to do so with impressive energy and enthusiasm. You are in it to win and will gladly take leading roles in relationships from the start, assuming personal responsibility for how smoothly things go and working actively to ensure a mutually rewarding experience. Romantic relationships are a serious business, and you are in it for the long haul.',
        friendship: 'In friendship, you seek personal growth and inspiration, and you often have a plan for how to accomplish it. Friendships of circumstance, built on things like shared routines, are not your preferred method. You prefer to seek out individuals who share your passion for deep, meaningful discussions and who enjoy learning and development as much as you do. It is not always easy to be friends with you, as you demand a lot from your relationships. But you pay a great deal of attention to your friendships and will work hard to make sure that they are fulfilling, inspiring, and, most of all, conduits for mutual self-improvement.',
        parenthood: 'As a parent, you are highly adept at spotting your children’s latent talents and nurturing these strengths. But you must, at times, temper your strong-willed, hyper-logical approach to life in order to make room for your children’s needs and feelings as you help them grow. This is simply to say that your relationship with children, who are typically more sensitive and less able to conduct truly rational analysis, require much more emotional tact and personal liberty than you are accustomed to giving. But you are always up for a challenge.',
        career: 'It is in the world of careers that you shine. Here, your boldness and drive are truly at their best. No one enjoys the hustle and grind of moving up the career ladder quite like you do. Your level of self-determination is unmatched.

        workplace: 'For you, the workplace is a natural habitat. Your efficiency and clear communication are valued, your leadership is admired, and your ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for you than others, as you prefer having the freedom to get your work done in a way that makes sense to you without being micromanaged. This can make work in any lower positions where you do not have personal autonomy a big challenge. You are able to adapt yourself to just about any work hierarchy by doing what they do best: taking initiative, asserting your opinions, and accomplishing seemingly impossible feats.',
